MathsTests is a simple app that can factorize polynomials using Ruffini's rule.
Project repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/marcocipriani01/MathsTests)

This app is currently out-of-development and was only meant as an experiment. I'm sorry if the code is not commented, not optimized and slow. Feel free to modify the app!
