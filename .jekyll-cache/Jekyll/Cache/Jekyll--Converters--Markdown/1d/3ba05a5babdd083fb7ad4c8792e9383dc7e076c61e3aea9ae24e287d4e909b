<h3 id="the-nebula">The nebula</h3>

<p>The Soul Nebula, also known as IC 1848 or Westerhout 5, is an emission nebula located in Cassiopeia and associated with several small open clusters. Itâ€™s 7500 light-years away.</p>

<p>34x 360 seconds at ISO 1600 (a record!), dark, flat, dark-flats and bias frames, processing in Astro Pixel Processor and The GIMP. Nikon D3300 with UHC filter from a very light polluted area, Sky-Watcher Newtonian 200mm f/5, EQ5. Due to the long focal length, the nebula is partially cropped, but the result is very satisfying!</p>
