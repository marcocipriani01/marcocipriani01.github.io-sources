I"><p>Iâ€™m a young astronomy enthusiast, attending the high school somewhere in Italy. In my free time, I take photos of the universe with my telescope and I often write some programs, utilities or Android applications to simplify its use. In my website I describe my projects and publish my photos of the universe.</p>
