<h2 id="the-comet">The comet</h2>

<p>46P/Wirtanen is a small short-period comet with an orbital period of 5.4 years,  discovered on January 17, 1948, by the American astronomer Carl A. Wirtanen. On 16 December 2018, the comet will pass 0.0774 AU (11,580,000 km) from Earth, reaching an estimated magnitude of 4.2~3</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve taken some 45 seconds exposures (ISO 800, for about one hour, with some delay between each photo) from my backyard and then I made this timelapse. Since the comet was really fast (long focal length, 1000, and APS-C sensor), I had to delete several frames, so the video has only 19 frames, manually processed in Astro Pixel Processor and then edited in a video with Kdenlive.</p>
