<p>M63, also known as NGC 5055 or the Sunflower Galaxy, is a spiral galaxy in the northern constellation of Canes Venatici. It was discovered by the French astronomer Pierre M√©chainin in 1779! It is 29.3 million light-years away from us, so it‚Äôs extremely faint (apparent magnitude 9.3)! It shows a spiral shape with no central bar, and moderate arms, and is classified as a ‚ÄúSAbc‚Äù galaxy in Edwin Hubble‚Äôs morphological classification; in other words, it is classified between ‚Äúnormal‚Äù spiral galaxies and galaxies with barred spirals. Indeed, it is also defined as a ‚Äúflocculent‚Äù (soft) galaxy, meaning it has discontinuous spiral arms. It has an estimated mass of  80~140 billion solar masses, and its diameter is about 90000 l-y, thus it is almost the size of the Milky Way. Incredible!</p>

<p>I used for the first time PHD2‚Äôs drift align, so I was able to point my telescope perfectly: thanks to this, I was able to capture 29 five minutes subs without having to delete any photo! Despite this fact, since the Moon was 95% illuminated and the light pollution was horrible, each RAW capture is more than ugly. Thanks to 23 darks, 170 offset frames and 100 flats (I exaggerated a bit, I think) I was able to fix this issues during the stacking process in Astro Pixel Processor and The GIMP, so the result is decent. I can do better, of course, but under clearer skies :wink:</p>
